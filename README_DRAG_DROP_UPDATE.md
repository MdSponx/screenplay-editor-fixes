## Repository Information
**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/MdSponx/screenplay-editor-fixes.git
**Local Development URL**: http://localhost:5175/

## Recent Updates

### ✅ Drag-and-Drop Scene Reordering Fix (Latest)
**Commit**: f6105d2 - "Merge remote changes with local drag-and-drop fixes"

#### Problem Solved
The drag-and-drop functionality for scene cards in the Scene Navigator was completely broken due to React 18 Strict Mode compatibility issues with the `react-beautiful-dnd` library.

#### Solution Implemented
1. **Library Upgrade**: Replaced `react-beautiful-dnd` with `@hello-pangea/dnd` v16.6.0 (React 18 compatible)
2. **Enhanced UX**: Added comprehensive error handling, loading states, and user feedback
3. **Search Integration**: Fixed search filter interference with drag-and-drop operations
4. **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript definitions for the new library

#### Key Features Added
- ✅ **Working Drag-and-Drop**: Scene cards can now be reordered by dragging
- ✅ **Real-time Sync**: Changes persist to Firestore and sync across users
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Loading spinners, success/error notifications
- ✅ **Search Protection**: Drag-and-drop disabled during search with clear warnings
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Proper Scene Numbering**: Correct scene numbers even when filtered

#### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Updated dependencies
- `src/components/SceneNavigator/SceneNavigator.tsx` - Enhanced with new library and UX
- `src/components/SceneNavigator/SceneCard.tsx` - Updated type definitions
- `src/hooks/useScenes.ts` - Improved error handling and async operations
- `DRAG_DROP_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive documentation

#### Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5175/
2. Sign in and access a screenplay editor
3. Click the "Scenes" tab to open the Scene Navigator
4. Test dragging scene cards by their grip handles (⋮⋮ icon)
5. Try searching to see the disabled state warning
6. Verify that reordered scenes persist after page refresh

#### Technical Details
- **React 18 Compatible**: Uses `@hello-pangea/dnd` instead of deprecated `react-beautiful-dnd`
- **Firestore Integration**: Batch operations for efficient database updates
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network issues and permission errors
