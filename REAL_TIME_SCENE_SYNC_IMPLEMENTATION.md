# Real-Time Scene Order Synchronization & Enhanced Save Feedback Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds real-time scene order synchronization between the Scene Navigator and Screenplay Editor, along with enhanced save status indicators and user feedback throughout the application.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Scene Order Synchronization**
- **Problem Solved**: Scene reordering in the Scene Navigator didn't update the main editor content in real-time
- **Solution**: Added automatic block reorganization when scene order changes are detected

#### Technical Implementation:
- Added `useScenes` hook to ScreenplayEditor for real-time scene data
- Created `reorganizeBlocksBySceneOrder` function to rebuild blocks array based on new scene order
- Added `useEffect` to watch for scene order changes and trigger reorganization
- Implemented scene-to-blocks mapping for efficient reorganization

#### Key Code Changes:
```typescript
// Real-time scene order synchronization
const { scenes, loading: scenesLoading, error: scenesError } = useScenes(projectId || '', screenplayId || '');

// Function to reorganize blocks based on scene order
const reorganizeBlocksBySceneOrder = useCallback((newScenes: typeof scenes) => {
  // Groups current blocks by scene and rebuilds in new order
  // Updates editor state with reorganized blocks
}, [state.blocks, setState, setHasChanges]);

// Watch for scene order changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (!scenesLoading && scenes.length > 0 && state.blocks.length > 0 && !loading) {
    // Check if scene order has changed
    // Trigger reorganization if needed
  }
}, [scenes, scenesLoading, state.blocks, loading, isReorganizingScenes, reorganizeBlocksBySceneOrder]);
```

### 2. **Enhanced Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
- **Library Upgrade**: Replaced `react-beautiful-dnd` with `@hello-pangea/dnd` for React 18 compatibility
- **Search Filter Fix**: Disabled drag-and-drop when search is active to prevent index mismatches
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Visual Feedback**: Added loading states, success/error notifications, and disabled states

#### Key Improvements:
- Toast notifications for reorder success/failure
- Visual warning when search prevents reordering
- Loading spinner during reorder operations
- Proper scene numbering even when filtered

### 3. **Enhanced Save Status Indicators**
- **Dynamic Save Button**: Shows different states (Save Changes, Saving..., Saved)
- **Visual Indicators**: Red pulse dot when changes are unsaved
- **Improved Feedback**: Better loading states and success/error messages
- **Status Persistence**: Clear indication of save state across the application

#### Save Button States:
1. **No Changes**: Gray button showing "Saved"
2. **Has Changes**: Gradient button with "Save Changes" and pulsing red dot
3. **Saving**: Spinner with "Saving..." text
4. **Success**: Green toast notification
5. **Error**: Red toast notification with error details

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Scene Reorganization Indicator**: Shows when scenes are being reorganized
- **Conflict Resolution**: Enhanced conflict dialog for concurrent edits
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback for all operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow:
1. **Scene Navigator**: User drags and reorders scenes
2. **Firestore Update**: Scene order saved to database via batch operation
3. **Real-time Listener**: `useScenes` hook detects order change
4. **Block Reorganization**: Editor automatically reorganizes blocks
5. **UI Update**: Main editor content reflects new scene order
6. **Save Indication**: Changes marked for saving

### State Management:
- **Scene State**: Managed by `useScenes` hook with real-time Firestore listener
- **Editor State**: Managed by `useEditorState` with block reorganization logic
- **Save State**: Managed by `useScreenplaySave` with enhanced feedback
- **UI State**: Loading, error, and success states for user feedback

## Files Modified

   - Implemented block reorganization logic
   - Added visual feedback for reorganization

2. **`src/components/SceneNavigator/SceneNavigator.tsx`**:
   - Enhanced drag-and-drop with React 18 compatibility
   - Added search filter handling
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

3. **`src/components/SceneNavigator/SceneCard.tsx`**:
   - Updated for new drag-and-drop library
   - Fixed TypeScript compatibility

4. **`src/components/ScreenplayNavigator.tsx`**:
   - Enhanced save button with dynamic states
   - Added visual indicators for unsaved changes
   - Improved save feedback

5. **`src/hooks/useScenes.ts`**:
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved Promise return types

### Package Updates:
- **Removed**: `react-beautiful-dnd@^13.1.1`
- **Added**: `@hello-pangea/dnd@^16.6.0`
- **Removed**: `@types/react-beautiful-dnd@^13.1.8`

## User Benefits

### 1. **Seamless Scene Management**:
- Drag scenes in navigator â†’ Editor updates instantly
- No need to refresh or manually save
- Real-time collaboration support

### 2. **Clear Save Status**:
- Always know if changes are saved
- Visual indicators prevent data loss
- Clear feedback for all operations

### 3. **Improved Reliability**:
- React 18 compatible drag-and-drop
- Better error handling and recovery
- Consistent behavior across browsers

### 4. **Enhanced Workflow**:
- Faster scene reorganization
- Immediate visual feedback
- Reduced cognitive load

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. **Basic Functionality**:
- [ ] Drag scenes in navigator updates editor immediately
- [ ] Scene order persists after page refresh
- [ ] Save button shows correct states
- [ ] Toast notifications appear and disappear correctly

### 2. **Edge Cases**:
- [ ] Reordering with search active (should be disabled)
- [ ] Multiple rapid reorders
- [ ] Network interruption during save
- [ ] Concurrent edits from multiple users

### 3. **Performance**:
- [ ] Large screenplays (100+ scenes)
- [ ] Rapid scene reordering
- [ ] Memory usage during reorganization
- [ ] Browser compatibility

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Advanced Features**:
- Undo/redo for scene reordering

## Deployment Notes

1. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install new drag-and-drop library
2. **Database**: No schema changes required
3. **Compatibility**: Backward compatible with existing data
4. **Testing**: Recommended to test in staging environment first
5. **Monitoring**: Watch for any performance impacts with large screenplays

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a seamless, real-time scene management experience with comprehensive user feedback. The combination of real-time synchronization, enhanced drag-and-drop, and improved save indicators creates a professional, reliable writing environment that scales with user needs.
